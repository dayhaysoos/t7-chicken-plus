# t7-chicken-plus

If you want to contribute to T7-Chicken-Plus, our JavaScript style guide is pretty much exactly like Rapid7's style guide for JavaScript:

https://github.com/rapid7/javascript-style-guide

## Requirments
Life would be very easy if you had a Mac, you have to install Xcode. For Android you'd have to install Android Studio and configure a virtual device to get it up and running

## Run locally:

> npm install -g react-native

Clone this repo:

> cd t7-chicken-plus
> npm install
>react-native run-ios 

## For Andriod:
Make sure your android virtual device is running
> react-native run-android

## Git

Master branch will be working version of the app

Develop branch will be the test branch, if you're building a new feature please take your branches off of develop.

Once develop branch looks good it will be merged into master

I'd really like to enforce code reviews through pull requests but it's really hard to make time for that since this isn't a real life job. 

If there are areas you think code can be improved please raise an issue for it.
