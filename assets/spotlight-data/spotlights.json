He has mained Julia Chang since her Tekken 3 release, but only started competing with her in August of 2016! Although not as tournament experienced as others, SourPiggy has made his name for himself by acquiring multiple top 8 and top 16 results. He has also managed to win 4 regional tournaments in his short career so far, with the latest victory using Julia Chang! Outside of tournaments, you can catch Piggy in his Twitch stream or his discord sharing Julia knowledge or being silly with his peers. He is a kind-hearted competitor who spreads peace, love and positivity to those around him while also reminding them to stay hydrated and drink water. Piggy's plans for the future are to improve his gameplay, grow his brand, expand the TCOL platform with his teammates, and help all those around him in AND out of the FGC."
