    "bio": "PepperBeef2Spicy is a competitive Tekken player & content creator from New Jersey. PepperBeef has been playing since Tekken 1 when he was just 3 years old, but he only started competing in Tekken in 2012 with Tekken Tag Tournament 2. PepperBeef mains three characters: Lei Wulong, Leo Klissen and Marshall Law; but he is most well known for his tricky and explosive Lei Wulong. A character which if PepperBeef isn't the best Lei player, he's certainly Lei's biggest fan. Originally only a content creator for Tekken, he initially made his mark on the community by making tutorials and montages for his favorite characters in Tekken Tag 2. But, come Tekken 7 he has proved himself to also be a dangerous threat in tournament. From 2017 to 2019 he has placed within the top 24 of several majors as well as landing in top 8 often in regional tournaments. PepperBeef has defeated some formidable top players along the way such as Lil Majin, Spero Gin and CherryBerryMango.  Initially playing Leo as his main in season 1 of Tekken 7, he has since made a full commitment switch to his favorite character Lei as his main character of choice but is looking forward to investing a lot of time in Leroy Smith in season 3. Following in the footsteps of \"LevelUpYourGame\" and \"AvoidingThePuddle\" PepperBeef hopes to educate new and upcoming Tekken players in the game's mechanics, metagame and in-depth character tutorials. But as for his own personal goal, PepperBeef hopes to become the best Lei Wulong player in the world, no matter where the character sits on the tier list."

He has placed top 8 in several TWT events and defeated many top players such as Knee, Jeondding, Qudans, Chikurin, and more.

Onlookers watch in awe and record videos of his hands as he effortlessly wavedashes in his opponents’ faces and performs “impossible” combos against top players in tournaments.  Maybe he’ll lose, but that’s only because the PS4 was set to the wrong video resolution. Outside of the game, KoDee stays busy with a real job that you probably couldn’t do. Still, he finds time to encourage others to improve their game through challenging their mentalities and encouraging hard work. He’s getting old but plans to commit actual time to Tekken while the scene is rapidly growing. He sometimes streams and sometimes plays well enough to win tournaments. He once won KiT and was carried by his team to become ELEAGUE champion.\nSeasoned tournament veteran. World competitor. Sponsored by multiple teams. Butt crack seen around the world.
